# Traffic-Sign-Classification
A deep learning classification model created using  Convolutional Neural Networks.
This project used Convolutional neural networks to classify our traffic sign image dataset of 43 categories.
TensorFlow and Keras were used to build this project.
The dataset consists of about 34,799 images for training, 4410 images for validation and 12,630 images for testing.
